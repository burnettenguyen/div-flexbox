                <p>I was born and raised in the Bay Area, CA, - right smack in the middle of Silicon Valley since the '80s, but my husband and I eventually moved to his hometown in Southwest Missouri. Where I currently live, I love the small community and friendly neighbors. Plus, we have plenty of space for our son and Bichon to run around in the outdoors.</p>

            <div class="div-2">
                <p>My passions: I have a few passions. I enjoy gardening and getting my hands dirty in the soil. I'm an urban hippie at heart. I enjoy meditation, experiencing holistic healing modalities, and learning about different sustainability practices to be a better steward of the earth. I also love going on adventures and exploring local places and surrounding towns.</p>

            <div class="div-3">
                <p>Fun fact: I received a black belt in Taekwondo when I was a teenager. I had a mean sidekick back in the day. Now, though, not sure I have the courage to throw a punch at somebody...</p>
